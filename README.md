# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is a Odin Project exercies which entailed the creation of a drawable whiteboard. 

Each tile of the whiteboard switches its background to black when the mouse enters the area of the tile itself. 

The number of tiles of the whiteboard can be changed from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of 100x100.

The clear button erases all the board's content. 

The rainbow button, once it is acrivated, colours the tile using a random color.
